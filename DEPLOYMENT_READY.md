## 🚀 Production Deployment Steps

### 1. Merge the Fixes
```bash
# The fixes are in PR #6
# Merge: https://github.com/Reshigan/SalesSyncAI/pull/6
```

### 2. Deploy to Production
```bash
# Clone/pull the latest code
git pull origin main

# Start the production deployment
docker-compose up -d --build

# Wait for services to start (2-3 minutes)
docker-compose ps

# Run database migrations
docker-compose exec backend npx prisma migrate deploy

# Seed the database
docker-compose exec backend npm run seed

# Verify deployment
curl http://localhost:3001/health
```

### 3. Monitor Deployment
```bash
# Check service status
docker-compose ps

# Monitor logs
docker-compose logs -f backend

# Check database connection
docker-compose exec backend npx prisma db pull
```

## 🔍 Pre-Deployment Checklist

- [ ] **Environment Variables**: Ensure all production environment variables are set
- [ ] **Database**: PostgreSQL database is running and accessible
- [ ] **SSL Certificates**: SSL certificates are configured for HTTPS
- [ ] **Domain Configuration**: DNS records point to the server
- [ ] **Backup**: Database backup is available
- [ ] **Monitoring**: Logging and monitoring systems are ready

## 🛡️ Rollback Plan

If deployment issues occur:

### Quick Rollback
```bash
# Stop current deployment
docker-compose down

# Revert to previous working commit
git revert HEAD

# Redeploy
docker-compose up -d --build
```

### Alternative Deployment
```bash
# Use the simple Dockerfile if issues persist
cd backend
docker build -f Dockerfile.simple -t salessync-backend .
```
